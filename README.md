# PBR: Patch-Based Discrete Registration 
Patch-based discrete registration for two n-dimensional volumes (e.g. images or medical 3D volumes).

## 3D Medical Registration
Run `registerNii` with example parameter and paths files in the `config` folder.

## 2D Image Registration
A wrapper for running 2D registration is in defelopment, but it should be quite easy to run `patchreg.multiscale` with a params file similar to the one in the `config` folder.
